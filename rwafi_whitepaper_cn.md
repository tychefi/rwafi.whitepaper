# RWA Yield Protocol Whitepaper
- `Version: 1.0`
- `Date: October 20, 2025`
- `Authors: TycheFi Labs`

## Abstract
ArtistYield RWA Protocol is a groundbreaking DeFi platform that bridges the gap between the creative arts industry and blockchain technology. By tokenizing artists' future revenue streams as Real World Assets (RWAs), the protocol enables decentralized funding for artists while providing investors with secure, yield-generating opportunities. Leveraging the platform's native SING token for fundraising and issuing GNIS credentials for participation, ArtistYield ensures transparent revenue sharing, minimum yield guarantees, and deflationary mechanics. This whitepaper outlines the protocol's architecture, tokenomics, and vision for revolutionizing artist financing in Web3.

### 1. Introduction
The entertainment and arts sector has long suffered from opaque funding models, intermediary dominance, and limited access to capital for emerging talents. Traditional revenue streams—such as royalties, tours, and merchandise—are often delayed or diluted by centralized entities. ArtistYield introduces a decentralized alternative: tokenizing artist revenue as RWAs over a fixed term (e.g., 10 years), allowing global investors to fund creators directly via blockchain.
Built on Ethereum-compatible chains, the protocol uses smart contracts for fundraising, yield distribution, and governance. Key features include a 60% fundraising threshold with platform backstop, staking rewards based on coin age, and a guarantor system ensuring at least 5% annual yields. This empowers artists to access capital without equity dilution while offering investors exposure to real-world yields with downside protection.

### 2. Problem Statement
Artists face significant barriers in securing funding:

High Intermediation Costs: Managers, labels, and platforms take large cuts, leaving creators with fractions of their earnings.
Liquidity Gaps: Future revenues are illiquid, making it hard to monetize without loans or advances carrying high interest.
Investor Risks: Traditional investments in arts lack transparency, with no real-time revenue tracking or guaranteed returns.
Global Accessibility: Emerging artists in underserved regions struggle to attract international capital.

DeFi has transformed finance, but RWAs in creative industries remain underexplored. ArtistYield addresses this by creating a secure, on-chain ecosystem for artist-backed investments.

### 3. Solution Overview
ArtistYield tokenizes an artist's projected revenue (e.g., from streams, concerts, NFTs) as an RWA. Artists and the platform co-launch fundraisers using SING tokens, issuing GNIS as investment credentials. Investors stake GNIS to earn 10% of artist revenues, distributed via smart contracts. A guarantor role ensures minimum yields, backed by collateral.
Key Components

Fundraising Mechanism: 2-week campaigns targeting 100,000 SING, with a 60% minimum threshold.
Yield Distribution: 80% to stakers (pro-rata by coin age), 10% for GNIS burns, 10% to guarantors.
Guarantee System: 5% annual minimum yield, covered by guarantor SING collateral.
Multi-Sig Fund Control: Ensures accountable disbursement to artists.

This model democratizes funding, enhances liquidity, and aligns incentives between creators and investors.

### 4. Technical Architecture
ArtistYield is deployed on Ethereum or Layer 2 solutions like Polygon for scalability. Core smart contracts handle:

Fundraiser Contract: Manages deposits, thresholds, and GNIS minting.
Staking Pool: Tracks coin age for fair yield allocation.
Revenue Oracle: Integrates Chainlink for off-chain revenue feeds.
Guarantor Contract: Enforces collateral formulas and annual payouts.

Protocol Flowchart
The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end process:

Fundraising Phase: Investors deposit SING, receive GNIS. If threshold met, funds lock in multi-sig.
Disbursement: Artist requests funds via approved milestones.
Revenue Ingestion: 10% of artist earnings converted to SING and deposited.
Distribution: Split across yield pool, burns, and guarantors.
Staking & Claims: GNIS stakers earn based on duration and amount.
Annual Guarantee: Shortfalls covered by collateral slashing.

Security measures include audits, oracle decentralization, and legal wrappers for RWA enforceability.

### 5. Tokenomics
SING Token

Utility: Fundraising currency, guarantor collateral, revenue conversion.
Supply: Platform-managed; used in multi-sig and pools.
Economics: Injected by platform for thresholds; rewards guarantors.

GNIS Token

Type: ERC-20 credential, 1:1 backed by SING investments.
Utility: Staking for yields; governance (future).
Deflationary: 10% of revenues swapped and burned.
Distribution: Minted to investors and platform during fundraising.

Total supply caps at fundraiser target (e.g., 100,000). Yields encourage long-term holding via coin age multipliers.

6. Guarantor Mechanism
Guarantors (e.g., platform treasury) stake SING to back minimum 5% annual yields. Collateral requirement:
Total Raised × 5% × (Term Years - Completed Years) / 2
Example (100,000 SING, 10-year term):

Year 1: 2,500 SING minimum.
Shortfalls slashed and distributed; rewards replenish pool.

This mitigates risk, ensuring investor confidence.
7. Roadmap

Q4 2025: Smart contract audits and testnet launch.
Q1 2026: Mainnet deployment, first artist pilot.
Q2 2026: Governance DAO activation, integrations with NFT platforms.
Ongoing: Expand to more artists, Layer 2 optimizations.

8. Risks and Mitigations

Oracle Failure: Use multiple oracles; fallback to manual verification.
Artist Default: Legal contracts enforce revenue reporting; guarantor covers minimums.
Market Volatility: SING pegged to stable assets; burns stabilize GNIS.
Regulatory: Comply with RWA laws (e.g., SEC); consult legal experts.

9. Conclusion
ArtistYield redefines artist-investor relationships in Web3, fostering a sustainable ecosystem for creative funding. By combining DeFi innovation with real-world assets, we unlock new revenue streams and democratize investment. Join us in building the future of decentralized arts finance.
